This PCBA design implements a replacement for the main "value" encoder
on the Roland JV-2080 synthesizer. This is useful because the original
part is no longer manufactured.

In short, this design leverages work available on mitxela.com,
namely: https://mitxela.com/projects/jv1080_encoder_repair . The code
shown on that page creates an elegant low-power interface between a
standard rotary encoder commonly available at the time of this writing
and what the JV-2080 expects. I encourage any reader here to explore
that page to learn more.
